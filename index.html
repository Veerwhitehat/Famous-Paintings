            <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
            <img src= "mona lisa.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
            <p>The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of 
                Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo 
                never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left 
                it in his will to his favored apprentice Salaì.[ It had been believed to have
                 been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working
                  on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the 
                  property of the French Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre, Paris 
                  since 1797.
                  <br><br>

                The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the
                 Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 
                 1962 (equivalent to $870 million in 2021).</p>

                <h2>Starry Night</h2>
                <img src="Starry night.jpg"  width="300px" height="300px">
                <p>Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio,
                     it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has
                      been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view
                       which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed]
                        including The Starry Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, 
                        Theo, around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in
                         the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."</p>

                         <h2>Washington Crossing the Delaware</h2>
                         <img src="Washington Crossing the Delaware.jpg"  width="300px" height="300px">
                         <p>Washington Crossing the Delaware are three 1851 oil-on-canvas paintings by the
                             German-American artist Emanuel Leutze. The paintings commemorate General George
                              Washington's crossing of the Delaware River with the Continental Army on the 
                              night of December 25–26, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War.</p>
